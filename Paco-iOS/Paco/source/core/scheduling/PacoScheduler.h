// The PacoScheduler schedules local notifications via UILocalNotification.  The
// experiment schedule is used to decide when to fire local notifications.  The
// local notification system can have at most 64 scheduled notifications per
// app. This means that there is a limit in how many experiments can be
// scheduled at once.
//
// The scheduler will create 3 local notifications for the experiment.  Each
// time the user opens the app with one of the notifications then the event
// is re-scheduled.  If the user fails to open 3 notifications in a row then
// the event will not be rescheduled until the next time they open the app.
