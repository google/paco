This sample demonstrates the OAuth 2 view controllers for iOS 3.2 and higher.

This sample uses a UINavigationController in its main view.

If your application's main view doesn't use UINavigationController, consider using your UIViewController's presentModalViewController: to push a new cover view that is a UINavigationController.
