Why?
----

Apple doesn't provide an API in iOS for presenting notification banners while the app is running. For many projects the most sensible way to respond to a remote push notification would be to display that notification (in the same style it is presented if your app is not foreground) and allow the user to determine whether the notification merits a response.

What?
-----

JCNotificationBannerPresenter allows you to display notification banners asynchronously from any piece of code in your application. It is not view/view-controller specific, you can use it directly from the AppDelegate, for example. It doesn't attempt to mimic the style of Apple's notifications; it seems better to avoid the uncanny valley presented by that endeavor. Just like Apple's notifications, however, this project slides down a banner from the middle of the status bar that times out after a set period of time and slides back up. The banner also can be dismissed by tapping on it, and a custom tap handler can be assigned to trigger some custom action.

Usage?
----

    #import "JCNotificationBannerPresenter.h"
    
    â€¦
    
    - (void) application:(UIApplication*)application didReceiveRemoteNotification:(NSDictionary*)notification {
      NSString* title = @"Push Notification";
      NSDictionary* aps = [notification objectForKey:@"aps"];
      NSString* alert = [aps objectForKey:@"alert"];
      [JCNotificationCenter
       enqueueNotificationWithTitle:title
       message:alert
       tapHandler:^{
         NSLog(@"Received tap on notification banner!");
       }];
    }

By default the banner style is iOS style, which presents banners with a 3D rotation. The project comes with an alternative Smoke appearance, which slides a semi-translucent window down from the status bar. If you want to use the same style for all notifications in your project, you can set the style at compile time by overriding or editing the `+presenterClass` method in JCNotificationCenter.

Notifications enqueued with the method `+enqueueNotificationWithTitle:message:tapHandler:` will time out in five seconds. You can change this on a per-notification basis by setting the timeout property in JCNotificationBanner and enqueing the banner with `-enqueueNotification:`. A value <= 0 will never timeout and requires user interaction to dismiss.

Installation?
-------------

This project includes a `podspec` for usage with [CocoaPods](http://http://cocoapods.org/). Simply add

    pod 'JCNotificationBannerPresenter'

to your `Podfile` and run `pod install`.

Alternately, you can configure your project to include the `QuartzCore` (`CoreGraphics` already includes `QuartzCore` ) framework and add all of the `.h` and `.m` files in this project. If your project does not use ARC, you will need to enable ARC on these files. You can enabled ARC per-file by adding the -fobjc-arc flag, as described on [a common StackOverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6646052/how-can-i-disable-arc-for-a-single-file-in-a-project).
