    <a name="finding"><h3>Finding and Joining Experiments</h3></a>
    <p>The easiest way to get started with Paco is to join an existing experiment. There are many examples.</p>
    <p>From the main screen, click on "Find Experiments". You might need to click "Refresh Experiments" to get a fresh list from the server of available experiments.
    When you see one that looks interesting, click on it to see the description, who created it, and the sampling schedule.</p>
    <p>If you think you might want to join that experiment, click "Join". This will take you to a page to see the data handling policy of the experiment creator.<br/>
    <b>Note: Only join experiments where you are satisfied with how the data will be handled.</b></p>
    <p>If you decide you feel comfortable with the experiment's data handling policy, then click the informed consent checkbox. Next you will be taken to the schedule settings for the experiment. 
    Usually you want to keep the default schedule, but perhaps you may need to slightly alter the times to suit your routine better.
    Press "Save Schedule" to complete the joining process.</p>
    <p>If you decide you don't want to join, just press the back button until you are back to the experiment list or the main page.<p>

    <a name="participating"><h3>Participating in an Experiment</h3></a>
    <h4>Signaling Experiments</h4>
    <p>Once you have saved the schedule, usually the experiment will ping you periodically to respond to the questions.</p> 
    <p>A notification will appear in the tray at the top of your phone screen and the phone will buzz or chime depending on your sound settings to alert you that it is time to respond to an experiment. 
    To respond, just draw the notification tray down and press on the experiment notice. This will take you to the experiment screen to 
    fill out the responses. When you are down filling out the experiment, press 'Save Response'. The experiment will show you some sort of confirmation page, usually with your just-entered responses. To exit, just press the back button when you are done."</p>
    <h4>Self Report Experiments</h4>
    <p>If the experiment is self-report only, it will not chime, but you may fill out the experiment at any point you prefer. To do this, click on "Running Experiments" from the main screen. This will show you a list of the experiments in which you are currently participating.
    Click on the name of experiment to which you wish to respond. This will open the experiment form and allow you to respond in the same manner as in the signaled response description above.</p>

    <a name="editing"><h3>Editing the Experiment Schedule</h3></a>
    <p>If you would like to modify the experiment's schedule for sampling, press "Running Experiments" from the main screen. Press the Clock icon next to the name of the experiment you want to modify. 
    This will take you to the same screen you saw when you joined the experiment so that you may change the schedule for sampling.</p>

    <a name="editing"><h3>Stopping the Experiment</h3></a>
    <p>If you would like to stop participating in an experiment, press "Running Experiments" from the main screen. Press the Stop Sign icon next to the name of the experiment you want to stop. This
    will stop any sampling. Your data is still available on the server and on the phone under "Explore Data", but you will not be prompted to enter data anymore and it will not be listed in your running experiments.</p>

    <a name="editing"><h3>Exploring Your Data</h3></a>
    <h4>On the phone</h4>
    <p>From the main screen, press "Explore Data". This will guide you through exploring your data on the phone. You can view your data in 4 ways, depending on the type of data:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Trends: You can see how the a variable in an experiment changes over time.</li>
    <li>Relationships: You can explore how two variables interact with each other.</li>
    <li>Distributions: You can see how the data ranges and what its' tendencies are.</li> 
    </ul>
    <h4>On the server</h4>
    <p>You can go to the server site and click on "Joined Experiments" to see the data from all the experiments in which you have participated. You can see basic charts, raw data, and export your data to another tool that allows more sophisticated exploration (R, SPSS, SAS, etc...).

    <a name="creating"><h3>Creating & Running Experiments</h3></a>
    <p>Certainly, you will want to create your own experiments to run on yourself, or perhaps with a population if you are a social scientists. Doing your own citizen science is what this is about after all.</p>
    <p>Creating experiments is easy, but not suited to the phone's form factor. Just point your desktop/laptop/netbook/tablet's web browser at the server address (available under the 'Contact Us' button on the home screen.) Once there, Choose "Administer Experiments" and "Create New" to create a new experiment.</p>
    <p>As soon as you have created it, it will be available to your phone. On the phone, go to "Find Experiments", click "Refresh Experiments" and you should see your newly created experiment even without having published it to yourself or anyone else. Join it as usual.</p>

    <h4>Contact about a specific experiment</h4>
    <p>As creators of PACO, we are not involved in any experiments other than those that we have personally created. 
    When you join an experiment, the email of the person who created it is listed in the description. You can also find this by looking at the experiment on the server. Please contact them with any questions about the specific experiment.</p>

      <dt>ESM</dt>
        <dd>Experiential Sampling Methodology is a technique pioneered by Mihalyi Csikszentmihalyi to get a better picture of a person's experience by randomly sampling them and inquiring about current experience. This is intended to get rid of schedule and recall bias. 
        </dd>

      <dt>experiment</dt>
        <dd>Our name for an individual PACO tracker you might create or join. We call them experiments because you may conduct clever interventions which are truly experiments, but even asking yourself questions on a periodic basis is a treatment, different from your normal activity and could count as an experiment in raised awareness. OK, we are open to better names - Send us your suggestions.
        </dd>      
      
      <dt>sampling</dt>
        <dd>The process of gathering data, often done at a scheduled time. This is usually the point when the phone notifies you and asks you to respond to an experiment. Your response is a sample.
