    <blockquote>"The unexamined life is not worth living"
    "Know Thyself"
    </blockquote>
    <P>We think those are words to live by.</p>
    <p>Paco is a platform for getting to "know thyself". You decide what to track and who sees it.</p>
    <p>Paco also allows you to create and participate in behavioral science studies with groups of other people to move science forward.</p>
    <h3>Here are some tips for getting started:</h3>
    <p>1) Press 'Find Experiments' to find existing experiments. Try some out.</p>
    <p>2) Press 'Current Experiments' to manage the experiments you have joined.</p>
    <p>3) Go to the server at http://pacoapp.com/ to create your own experiments or copy and modify existing ones</p>
    <p>4) Press 'Explore Data' to look at patterns in your data.</p>
    <p>This is an early beta version, but we hope you like it and please tell us about your experiences and how you are using it.</p>
    <p>We wish you well.</p>
