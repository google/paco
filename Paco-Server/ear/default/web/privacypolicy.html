    <p>The Paco Privacy Policy<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      We at Paco are committed to protecting your digital privacy. This
      statement is a description of the policy that governs how we collect and
      use information in the Paco app and on the Paco site. If you have any
      questions, please email us at privacy@pacoapp.com.</p>
    <p>Please note that we may change this privacy policy from time
      to time. You should check it regularly for changes, but we will never sell
      or otherwise disclose your personally identifiable information to anyone
      else unless we are compelled to do so by law (see below).<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Information that we collect:<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      We collect only three kinds of information in Paco: 1) anonymous user
      information; 2) your email address, used as credentials for
      authentication, and/or, if you choose to email us; and 3) information that
      you store in Paco which is your private data or data that is part of an 
      experiment you have joined in which case it is private to the experimenter 
      and you according to the specific Data Handling Policy they have presented 
      in the informed consent when joining an experiment.<br>
      <br>
      1) When you browse the Paco site, or use the Paco app, we collect only the
      following limited, data:<br>
      <br>
      Our servers may record the numerical Internet protocol (IP) address of the
      computer or phone you are using, the operating system and browser you use,
      the date and time you access our site, and the Internet address of the web
      site from which you linked to the Paco site.<br>
      <br>
      We use this information to diagnose system problems, to measure the number
      of visitors we receive and what pages on the Paco site are most popular
      (but we never conduct audit trails that measure what pages individual
      users visit), and to improve the site. We may also use this information to
      block computers that are attempting denial of service attacks on Paco
      servers or for similar security purposes.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      We may share this anonymous information with selected affiliates of Paco,
      but we will never disclose information that identifies you personally to
      anyone outside of Paco unless compelled by law (see below).<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      2) Paco also invites visitors to participate via our mailing lists. You
      will need to register if you would like to participate in our lists.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      The only information you must provide if you choose to register is your
      e-mail address. We use this information for verification purposes; also,
      if you sign up for our announcements list (see below), then we will send
      the announcements to the e-mail address you give us here. We will not
      disclose your e-mail address to anyone else unless compelled by law (see
      below).<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      You may choose to let use place a cookie on your PC if you would like to
      log on to Paco automatically. We will use the cookie only to log you on,
      and for no other purpose.<br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      You may also choose to receive occasional announcements via The Paco
      Announcements list on our website. You must voluntarily subscribe in order
      to receive these announcements.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      You may also send e-mail to Paco via the e-mail address on the Paco web
      site. When you choose do this, we collect the address of the e-mail
      account that you sent the message from and any information that you choose
      to include in the message. We will not share this information with third
      parties unless compelled by law.</p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p>3) Paco is a personal data collection device. The data that you collect
      in your experiments with yourself and with others is your private data. At
      Paco, we do not access or share this information with anyone unless
      compelled by law (see below).<br>

      None.<br>

      &nbsp;<br>
      If you want to get information about you that may be in our records, or if
      you want us to remove any correct any information you have given us, just
      let us know. Contact the site administrator at: remove@pacoapp.com.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      If you signed up to receive Paco announcements and you do not want to
      receive them anymore, at the bottom of each announcement mail is a link
      that will remove you from the list.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Law enforcement and other compelled disclosures:<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      If we are required by law (including by a court order) to disclose any
      information you have submitted to us, we will attempt to provide you with
      notice (unless we are prohibited) that a request for your information has
      been made and give you an opportunity to object to the disclosure. We will
      attempt to give you this notice by e-mail, if you have given us an e-mail
      address, or by postal mail if you have given us a postal address. If we
      are unable to contact you, if you do not challenge the disclosure request,
      or if we are still required to disclose the information despite your
      challenge, we will disclose it as required by law.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Security of information under our control:<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Our databases, including the database of registered users and system
      administrations logs, are password protected. Password information is
      encrypted in the database.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      A cookie is information that a web site puts on your hard disk so that it
      can remember something about you at a later time. Unless a web site uses a
      cookie, the web page server has no memory of what pages it has sent you
      previously or anything about your previous visits.</p>
