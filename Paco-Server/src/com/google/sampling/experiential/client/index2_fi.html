If you decide that an experimental input isn't quite right, just update it and then within a day the Android app will pick up the new definition.</span></b></div>

It offers a choice of questions about trends in the data, relationships in the data, and the distribution of the data.

                <ul><li>Example: You decide to practice healthy eating by following, say, the guidelines in Michael Pollan's&nbsp;<a href="http://michaelpollan.com/books/food-rules/">Food Rules</a>, and you want to see how well are following the program.&nbsp;&nbsp;With PACO and an Android phone you can easily create a personal "experiment" that will automatically ask you to rate your meal based on the three core food rules (Did you eat food? Was it mostly plants? Was it too much?) and help you track them. You can also easily add weight, blood pressure, cholesterol, etc., to the data you track and collect.</li>

                  <ul><li>Example: You would like to keep track of where you spend your time at work (34% of my time in meetings! Aaargh!) and how productive or passionate you are feeling about your work. &nbsp;The best way to collect this data is to use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experience_sampling_method">Experience Sampling Method</a> (ESM for short.) With PACO you can easily create a simple ESM study that will ask you at random times what you are doing and, say, if you are feeling productive and passionate at that particular time.</li></ul></ul>
