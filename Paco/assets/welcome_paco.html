    Someone once said, 
    <blockquote>"The unexamined life is not worth living"</blockquote>
    And someone else once said,
    <blockquote>"Know Thyself"</blockquote>
    </p>  
    <P>We agree! Those are words to live by.</p>
    <p>Paco is a platform for creating your own experiments about yourself. You decide what to track, and who sees it. You keep it on your phone, or in the cloud, and you can share it with your friends (not their social network provider).</p>
    <p>Paco also allows you to create and participate in behavioral science studies with groups of other people.</p>
    <p>This is an early beta version, but we hope you like it and we hope to hear how you are using it.</p>
    <p>We wish you well.</p>
